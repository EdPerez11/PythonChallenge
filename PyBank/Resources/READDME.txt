The code was created witht the help of the Expert Learner AI tool in class. I reviewed the previous classes with Khaled, created my code and type it in the expert learner for feedback.
The expert learner corrected my code and guided me through improving it to get the desired results. I also worked together with Nicole and Zahraa as we struggled initially but with the help of the study materials and each other we were able to effectively developed the code.
For the output results in the Analysis text, I used this command in the terminal prompt python main.py > analysis.txt after googling how to export results into text files.
The command redirects the output of the script to a text file automatically. I used this to avoid adding more lines of code to my script.
